          <p>
            "var", "let" and "const" are keywords in javaScript. They are used
            to declare variables. "var" declarations are globally scoped or
            function scoped while "let" and "const" are block scoped. Variables
            declared with "var" are hoisted to the top of their containing
            function or global scope. This means we can access a "var" variable
            before it's declared in the code, while we can't access a variable
            which is declared with "let" or "const".

          <p>
            In JavaScript, both "null" and "undefined" are special values that
            represent the absence of a meaningful value. "undefined" means the
            variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned and
            "null" means an empty value or a blank value. Common use cases for
            "null" is often initializing a variable that is expected to hold a
            value but doesn't have a value yet. Common use cases for undefined
            is declaring a variable without initializing it, and when accessing
            an object property that does not exist.

          <p>
            Full form of REST API is Representational State Transfer Application
            Programming Interface. A REST API is an API that confirms to the
            design principles of the REST. It is a widely used and popular
            approach for building web-based APIs because of its simplicity and
            scalability. REST is not a specific technology or protocol; rather,
            it's a set of guidelines that define how web services should behave
            and how clients should interact with them.
